今天学习了怎么用hugo 创建自己的博客，还选了一个很好看的主题，是紫色的，很好看。

The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."

And off he walked very, very scornfully.

Moral of the story:

> There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.
